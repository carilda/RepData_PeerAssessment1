if (!file.exists(activity.zip)) {
    stop("data source file activity.zip missing")
}
DT <- data.table(read.csv(file = "activity.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA",  stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
DT$datedate <- as.Date(DT$date)
DT$datefactor <- as.factor(DT$date)

```

DT2 <- DT[complete.cases(DT)]
